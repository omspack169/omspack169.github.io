Pack 169 meets at the Olive-Mary Stitt Elementary School in Arlington Heights, IL and we are chartered by the Rotary Club of Arlington Heights.

We were founded in 1965 by the OMS PTA and have operated continously ever since.

Part of the Pathway to Adventure Council Northwoods District http://www.pathwaytoadventure.org/districts/north-woods/


The Boy Scouts of America elected this year to open up Cub Scouts to girls in K-5 as well as boys.  

Pack 137 will be accepting girls into the Pack in accordance with the national BSA's guidelines and policies.

As stated by the BSA, Dens will be separated by gender for den meetings.  All girl dens are required to have at least 1 female registered adult leader.  Girl dens will operate the same in that an optimal number of Scouts (with identified adult leaders) needs to be enrolled (at least 3).  If the numbers are not sufficient to support a full Den at each level, Dens may contain scouts concurrently working on different ranks.

	
Pack 137 is chartered by Hancock United Church of Christ and serves Scouts in Kindergarten through 5th grades, mostly from the Estabrook, Hastings, and Harrington school districts in Lexington, Massachusetts.

The Cub Scout program teaches Scouts about Community, Family, Outdoors, and Self through a set of fun, organized activities.

​The Boy Scouts of America elected this year to open up Cub Scouts to girls in K-5 as well as boys.

Cub Scouting is a family activity.  Families are involved in a number of ways.  Many of the requirements for completing the Lion, Bobcat, Tiger, Wolf, Bear, and Webelos badges require family involvement. 

The pack is also organized and run solely by parent volunteers.  Our goal is to have the parent(s) of every family help out with at least one to two pack events each year in addition to supporting and/or running a den.



Uniforms
Wearing the Uniform is an important part of Scouting. Our uniforms help to create a sense of belonging. They symbolize character development, citizenship training, and personal fitness. Wearing a uniform gives youth and adult members a sense of identification and commitment.

Lions wear a Lion T-Shirt and hat.

Tigers, Wolves, & Bears wear the Navy Button down, neckerchief, slide, and hat for their rank.

Webelos and Arrow of Light Scouts wear the Tan Button down, neckerchief, slide, and hat for their ranks.
